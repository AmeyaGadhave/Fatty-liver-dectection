# Fatty-liver-dectection

A deep learning–based computer vision project that detects fatty liver regions from ultrasound images using a U-Net segmentation architecture. The system includes complete preprocessing, augmentation, mask generation, training, and evaluation pipelines. The model achieves 98.7% training accuracy and 77.36% validation accuracy, with automated segmentation outputs and performance visualization. This project demonstrates an end-to-end medical imaging workflow—covering data handling, model training, quality evaluation, and deployment-ready output generation.

This project was fully developed and trained on Google Colab, using GPU-accelerated execution for optimal model performance.
The dataset used for training and mask generation is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aODOFHm_ZdFKalaU9gG5LZWfSBE82zKz?usp=sharing
